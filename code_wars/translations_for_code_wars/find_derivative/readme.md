Calculate the derivative of a polynomial

Complete the function that calculates the derivative of a polynomial. A polynomial is an expression like: `$ 3x^4 - 2x^2 + x - 10 $`

### How to calculate the derivative:

* Take the exponent and multiply it with the coefficient
* Reduce the exponent by 1

For example, derivative of `$ 3x^4 $` is `$ (4\cdot3)x^{4-1} = 12x^3 $`


### Good to know:

* The derivative of a constant is 0.
* Anything to the 0th exponent equals 1 (e.g. `$ x^0 = 1 $`).
* The derivative of the sum of two function is the sum of the derivatives.


### Notes:

* The exponentiation is marked with `^`
* Exponents are always integers and >= 0
* Exponents are written only if > 1
* There are no spaces around the operators
* Leading `+` signs are omitted

### Examples

```text
Derivative of "-100"      is "0"
Derivative of "4x+1"      is "4"
Derivative of "-x^2+3x+4" is "-2x+3"
```
